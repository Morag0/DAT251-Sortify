## üöÄ Getting Started

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sortify-DAT251/DAT251-Sortify.git
cd DAT251-Sortify
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Backend without Docker**
If you want to run the backend without Docker, follow these steps:

```bash
cd DAT251-Sortify/backend
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew bootJar
./gradlew bootRun
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Backend with Docker Locally**
To run the backend using Docker locally, follow these steps:

1. ### START DOCKER DESKTOP ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE

2. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Build the Docker Image (remember the period after "sortify-backend")
docker build -t sortify-backend .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 9876:9876 sortify-backend
```

The backend should now be running on http://localhost:9876. You can access it by visiting this URL in your browser or through an API client like Postman.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshoot**
If you run into trouble with the program

**1.** Clean Gradle caches and restart the build:

```bash
./gradlew --stop
 rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches
  rm -rf .gradle
./gradlew clean build --stacktrace
```

**2.** Try closing and re-opening the IDE.

**3.** If you're using `VSCode`, try uninstalling "Kotlin by fwcd" and only use "Kotling Language by mathiasfrohlich"

**If you're still having troubles, ask chat..**
